Adds `httpError` to toast, a utility for displaying error toasts with a fallback title.

This utility provides a consistent approach for handling error toasts across the application. It supports detailed handling for HTTPError instances and includes a fallback title for non-HTTP errors. Refactored existing error toasts to use this new utility.
